# LogisticRegression_Fertility_Dataset

This is a Python code for implementing logistic regression on the Fertility Dataset. The dataset comprises various features related to the fertility status:

<ol>
<li>Season</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Child diseases</li>
<li>Accident</li>
<li>Surgical intervention</li>
<li>High fevers</li>
<li>Alcohol consumption</li>
<li>Smoking habits</li>
<li>Hours of sitting per day</li>
<li>Additionally, the dataset includes a target variable, "diagnosis," which represents the fertility diagnosis (e.g., normal or altered).</li>
</ol>

The dataset can be accessed from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/244/fertility.

The code utilizes the scikit-learn library to perform logistic regression, aiming to predict fertility status based on the given features. It includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

These questions has been answered:
<ol>
<li>e.1 How can I measure the performance of my model?</li>
<li>e.2 What are: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall & F1 Score, ROC & AUC. Log Loss?</li>
</ol>
