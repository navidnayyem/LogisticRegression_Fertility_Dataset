# LogisticRegression_Fertility_Dataset

This is a Python code for implementing logistic regression on the Fertility Dataset. The dataset comprises various features related to the fertility status:

Season
Age
Child diseases
Accident
Surgical intervention
High fevers
Alcohol consumption
Smoking habits
Hours of sitting per day
Additionally, the dataset includes a target variable, "diagnosis," which represents the fertility diagnosis (e.g., normal or altered).

The dataset can be accessed from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/244/fertility.

The code utilizes the scikit-learn library to perform logistic regression, aiming to predict fertility status based on the given features. It includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
